\title{Harmonize crop yields
Performs initial data processing steps for crop yield data. 
These include:
- Filling in missing actual_crop_id with expected_crop_id. 
- Calculating dry yield from yield and yield_percent_moisture (for crops 
with yields reported at standardized moisture).
- Optionally, the function can reshape the data into a wide format,
with multiple crop fractions (e.g., grain and straw) in separate columns instead of
separate rows, as they are organized in the database. This option may be convenient 
for harvest index calculations and such.}
\usage{
harmonize_yields(
  crop_yields = NULL,
  crop_fractions_as_columns = FALSE,
  public = getOption("drivesR.default.public"),
  primary_crop_fractions = getOption("drivesR.primary_crop_fractions"),
  mytoken = getOption("drivesR.default.directustoken")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{crop_yields}{A data frame of the crop_yields table from the DRIVES database. If left as NULL, 
this table will be downloaded via the Directus API.}

\item{crop_fractions_as_columns}{If TRUE, multiple fractions from the same crop are organized in separate 
columns. If FALSE, multiple fractions from the same crop are organized in separate rows, 
as in the database table.}

\item{public}{TRUE if data are to be downloaded from the publicly available part of the DRIVES 
database. FALSE otherwise. Can be set directly or though options.}

\item{primary_crop_fractions}{A vector of crop fractions to select as the primary fraction, when there is more than one.
So far, this only pertains to grain and tomato fruit. The default is set with the 
option drivesR.primary_crop_fractions.}

\item{mytoken}{Directus token, formatted as "Bearer myapitoken". Can be set with set_default_token().}
}
\value{
A data frame of lightly processed crop yield data. Information stored in the table
is used to generate new columns, including dry yield (in kg/ha) and a TRUE/FALSE 
column for cover crops.

If crop_fractions_as_columns is set to TRUE, 
data describing fractions from the same crop will be described in separate columns, with 
suffix _1 for the primary fraction and _2, _3, etc. for other fractions.
