# drivesR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of drivesR is to facilitate data management and analysis for members of the [Diverse Rotations Improve Valuable Ecosystems Services (DRIVES) Project](https://www.drives-network.org/) and anyone interested in using the publicly-available portions of the DRIVES database. 

The DRIVES database contains yield and weather data from 21 long-term agricultural field experiments with a crop rotation component. You can find out more about our research and participating sites at our website, [drives-network.org/](https://www.drives-network.org/). Metadata and a full data inventory can be found at the [DRIVES database repository](https://hdl.handle.net/10779/USDA.ADC.28654694) on Ag Data Commons: https://hdl.handle.net/10779/USDA.ADC.28654694.

As of May 2025, access to DRIVES database requires an API key. Project members and collaborators can request an API key from the DRIVES data manager. Other users must complete our [data use survey](https://www.drives-network.org/data-request) and agree to our data use terms. Outside users will have read access to a subset of the data excluding sites and site years embargoed from public access.
